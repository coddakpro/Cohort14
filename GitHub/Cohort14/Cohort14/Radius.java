 * Exercise 2.22
 * Write an application that inputs from the user the radius of a circle as an integer and
 * prints the circle's diameter, circumference and area using the floating-point value 3.14159 for π.
 * Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.7.
 * [Note: You may also use the predefined constant Math.PI for the value of π.
 * This constant is more precise than the value 3.14159. Class Math is defined in package java.lang.
 * Classes in that package are imported automatically, so you do not need to import class Math to use it.]
 * Use the following formulas (r is the radius):
 * diameter = 2r
 * circumference = 2πr
 * area = πr²
 * 
 * Do not store the results of each calculation in a variable. Rather, specify each calculation as the
 * value that will be output in a System.out.printf statement. Note that the values produced by the
 * circumference and area calculations are floating-point numbers. Such values can be output with the
 * format specifier %f in a System.out.printf statement.

/* Output:
 * Enter the radius of the circle: 6
 * Diameter of the circle is 12
 * Circumference of the circle is 37.70
 * Area of the circle is 113.10
